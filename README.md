Personal Portfolio Website
What the project is

This is a personal multi page portfolio website built using only HTML and CSS. The project includes a Home page, About page, Projects page, and Contact page. It showcases my journey as a beginner web developer and creative designer, focusing on clear structure, readability, and simple layout logic.

The website was created as part of my web development learning process, with the goal of strengthening my understanding of HTML structure, CSS properties, and multi page navigation.

What I learned

While building this project, I practiced and improved my understanding of:

Writing clean and semantic HTML

Creating multi page websites and linking pages correctly

Structuring content using sections and containers

Styling with CSS including spacing, typography, colors, and buttons

Understanding margins, padding, and basic layout behavior

Debugging layout issues caused by structure rather than syntax

This project helped me become more confident working with HTML and CSS before moving on to more advanced layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid.
